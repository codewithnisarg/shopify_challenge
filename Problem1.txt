Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. 
We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). 
When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. 
Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis.

1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 

--> After loading data, i have done some analysis on it and i found that order value have some high transaction with value of 704000. 
Here, we have calculated the average value of order value to measure central tendency. In normal circumstances where our data is normally 
distributed, it is recommanded to use mean value. However, in our case mean value is affected by the outliner. Hence, we need to use more 
reliable methods like median as it is not influence by extremely large values and trimmed mean where we trim the distribution of AOV.

2. What metric would you report for this dataset?

--> Here, i have used median and trimmed mean.

3. What is its value?

--> With the help of 3% trimmed mean method we have obtained an AOV of 299.059$ which is lower than previous AOV. 
      Morever, in the case of median, we have received 284 which is near to new AOV.
